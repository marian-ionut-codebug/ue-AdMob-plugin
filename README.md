 Google Admob android plugin for Unreal Engine
> This document describes about UE project setting configuration for using AdMob plugin AdBox.

AdMob is a mobile advertising platform developed by Google, designed to help app developers monetize their mobile applications through in-app advertising.

AdBox is Android plugin for Unreal Engine which provides methods to integrate AdMob easily to UE projects, especially for UE version 4.27.

In fact, Unreal Engine also provides AdMob in it but UE 4.27 is older version and it doesnâ€™t work anymore nowadays because AdMob has changed a lot from the time when UE 4.27 had been released.

You should configure some project settings in UE 4.27 for using AdBox by following steps below:

- [Android Minimum SDK Version](#android-minimum-sdk-version)
- Add AdMob Advertising Unit IDs
- Disabling Google Plugins
- How to use AdBox in the project

## Android Minimum SDK Version

<span style="color: red;">You must change the minimum Android SDK version to 26.</span>
This is because AdBox uses high version of AdMob module in it.
